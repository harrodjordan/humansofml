# Welcome to Humans of ML/AI! 

[@HumansofML](http://twitter.com/humansofml) is a Twitter account created by Jordan Harrod that features weekly curation by AI/ML developers and researchers from industry, academia, policy, and beyond! 
Our goal is to engage the public on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning by highlighting the people behind the algorithms. 

Do you want to volunteer your time to curate the account for a week? [Fill out our curation sign up form here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBbVwDcTv2Ve8RYLoSE1nw7odQBCdUnyL23Y4LKNhIoixQtw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Sep 9-15: Blakeley H. Payne (@blakeleyhpayne) is a graduate research assistant at the MIT Media Lab where she studies the ethics of artificial intelligence. Specifically, she develops educational materials to teach children to be both conscientious consumers and designers of AI systems. Before joining MIT, she completed her undergraduate studies at the University of South Carolina, where she earned a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics. Blakeley has completed several AI internships at institutions such as Adobe, Inc., where she worked on building CNNs for masking problems and U.C. Berkeley where she worked on inverse reinforcement learning for self driving cars.

Sep 16-22: Laura Hanu (@HanuLaura) - In the last 2 years, I have worked as a Data Scientist at Visulytix, an AI start-up, working on developing deep learning models, from segmentation & object detection to GANs, for ophthalmic images. My main interests are in unsupervised learning and deep representations. Previously, I was part of Dr. Anil Bharath's BICV group at Imperial College London, working on 3D unsupervised learning models, and Professor Ralph Sinkus' group at King's College London, working on leveraging fractal properties in medical imaging. Some of my research interests include AI safety & explainability, neurotechnology and the underlying mechanisms of imagination and creativity. I have previously given talks about the work that I do e.g https://www.london.ai/speaker/laura-hanu/ and http://ucldata.com/syllabus.php
